# Exploring Dietary Patterns and Country Relationships in European Countries

## About the Project

This project explores the dietary patterns and interrelationships between European countries based on their protein consumption. It utilizes a dataset containing estimates of average protein consumption from various food sources for 25 European countries. The analysis aims to uncover dietary similarities and differences, identify key protein intake factors, and explore country relationships based on dietary variables.

## Dataset Information

The dataset includes average grams of protein consumed per person daily from different food sources such as meat, dairy, legumes, grains, and seafood. Each row represents a country, and the columns represent specific food items contributing to protein intake. The dataset provides insights into the dietary habits of European populations and serves as a valuable resource for understanding dietary trends and cultural influences.

## Analysis Techniques Used

1. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** PCA is used for dimensionality reduction and data visualization. It helps identify patterns and relationships between countries based on their protein consumption patterns.

2. **Cluster Analysis:** Cluster analysis categorizes countries into groups based on similarities in their dietary variables. It aids in uncovering patterns and structures within the dataset, facilitating segmentation for targeted strategies and decision-making.

## Findings and Insights

- **Balkan Countries:** Countries such as Albania, Romania, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria exhibit dietary patterns characterized by a significant consumption of cereals and bread made from wheat.
- **Southern European Countries:** Portugal, Spain, Italy, and Greece follow a Mediterranean diet rich in seafood, olive oil, fruits, vegetables, and grains.
- **Eastern European Countries:** The USSR, Hungary, Poland, East Germany, and Czechoslovakia have diets influenced by Soviet food policies, emphasizing meat, potatoes, grains, and dairy products.
- **Western and Northern European Countries:** This group, including Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and West Germany, has diverse diets with a reliance on seafood, dairy products, and various types of meat.
